# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Oxc](https://oxc.rs)
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/)

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Linting and type checking

TypeScript 7 no longer exposes the compiler API used by the current
TypeScript-ESLint releases. ESLint therefore parses TypeScript with Babel and
continues to enforce the core JavaScript and React Hooks rules. Type safety,
unused locals, and unused parameters are enforced separately by `tsc` in the
build and CI type-check steps.
